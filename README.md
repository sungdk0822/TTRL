# 🎉News

- **[2025-05-23]** We update both the paper and the code, with the implementation based on the [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl).

- **[2025-04-24]** We release the code and experimental logs. Check it out: [Getting Started](#getting-started).

- **[2025-04-23]** We present **TTRL** (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), an open-source solution for online RL on data without ground-truth labels, especially test data.

# 📖Introduction

We investigate Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs).
The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information.
While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training.

# 📃Evaluation

Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the `pass@1` performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 211% on `AIME 2024` with only unlabeled test data.

Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the `maj@n` metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass this upper limit of the initial model, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels.

# ✨Getting Started

You can reproduce the results on `AIME 2024` with the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PRIME-RL/TTRL.git
cd verl

pip install -r requirements.txt

bash examples/ttrl/aime.sh
```

We additionally conducted three independent runs using the preview version of our code. Two of the runs achieved a pass@1 of 43.3, while one run reached 46.7. Please refer to the [Weights & Biases logs](https://wandb.ai/truman-yx-zuo-nlp/TTRL/workspace).

*All experiments were conducted on 8 * NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs.*

The implementation of TTRL can be achieved rapidly by simply modifying the reward function. Please refer to the following code snippet for details:
